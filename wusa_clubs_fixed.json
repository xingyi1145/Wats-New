We also advocate for waste reduction and other sustainable practices through social media, workshops, and volunteer events. Why did we start? UW Campus Compost was established in 2014 to bring compost bins to campus back when the University did not have an organic waste collection system. Before its establishment, much of the groundwork started in 2012 under the \"University of Waterloo Compost Coalition\", lead by a team of Environment students. Since then, the University has started its own organic waste program which makes organics disposal even more convenient on campus. While we still conduct our compost operations, we have expanded our mission to include advocacy around sustainability through campaigns and events.

    "description": "Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Canada is a non-profit national organization that was founded by two University of Waterloo students. This mission statement of the organization is to bring people and ideas together to tackle the most crucial causes of poverty and inequality. The organization consists of chapters from across Canada, with members from all academic backgrounds (not just engineering), that use long-term development and systemic innovation to raise awareness and create change. The EWB University of Waterloo Chapter does impactful work on campus, in the Kitchener-Waterloo region, and overseas. One of our most successful on campus projects is our podcasts which advertise the systems thinking approach to a variety of different issues. Our youth engagement program has enabled us to educate high school and elementary students on the importance of social issues and long-term solutions. Also, we advocate to the public and politicians to dedicate more resources towards international development. We run fundraising events to raise money for social enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa. Every year, we hire a Junior Fellow to work for 4 months at a social enterprise in Sub-Saharan Africa. The ability for our chapter to truly make a difference the world depends on the commitment and effort put in by our outstanding team members. No matter what faculty you're from, we would love to have you be a part of our team. Together, we can help eliminate poverty and inequality in the world."

In addition, our club organizes a number of intramural co-ed sports teams (Basketball and Volleyball, usually) and social functions (pool tournaments, bowling, etc.) and outings (dinners, horseback riding, skiing trips) that form the bulk of our time commitments. We hope to create a 'family' atmosphere by developing an hierarchy-less club that is devoted to providing an avenue for interaction amongst Sikh students at our University. UW SSA also provides educational help (study groups, old texts, exams, etc.) and holds one of the most successful on-campus events, 'Dastaar day', previously known as 'Turban Day' once a semester. This is an awareness day to teach the University community about the significance of the turban in Sikhism. We desire to produce conditions conducive to the further study, research and practice of Sikhism by our fellow Sikh students and all others interested in any aspect of the Sikh religion."

We will strive to lessen the barrier of entry, which prevents so many Canadians from getting involved in politics. We will do this by bringing together students who have already begun their political journeys and those who want to get started on their own, as well as politicians and activists who have established a political space for themselves, to work together for their common goals."
